# tox --> virtual --> importlib_metadata (latest)
# Latest version (>5.0.0) is incompatible with kombu used in production (4.6.11)
# Since this host is use to execute wazo-ansible playbooks (i.e. install a
# wazo), we should use same version than debian to avoid conflict.
# However, since latest tox version is only compatible with
# importlib-metadata>=4.8.3, using <5.0.0 should be good enough for both usage.
# This fix should be removable on next debian version (Bullseye)
